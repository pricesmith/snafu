# snafu

Mostly, a distributed KV store to experiment and understand how graph dbs and kg's work, understand the tradeoffs, and convince myself I can work on an alternative if nothing fits my use cases. Also, yet another overly-ambitious project to learn rust. 

Primary goal:
-- Explore distributed p2p arch and impl for KV stores, particularly for the use case of distributed, p2p kgs.
